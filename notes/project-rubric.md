** Exploration

  if you clustered the data as an exploration, why did you choose
  those clustering parameters? If you present the data graphically,
  why did you choose that visualisation?)

** Learning 

- What algorithms did you use? 

- Why did you use them?

** Evaluation

- Report how effective your model is

- Compare that model to other (less effective) models and offer
  reasons for this.
