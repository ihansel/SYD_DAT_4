    "- How would you assess model accuracy?\n",
    "- Explain what regularization is and why it is useful.\n",
    "- Explain what resampling methods are and why they are useful. Also explain their limitations.\n",

    "- What is a recommendation engine? How does it work?\n",
    "- Which tools do you use for visualization? What do you think of Tableau? R? SAS? (for graphs). How to efficiently represent 5 dimension in a chart?\n",
    "- Are you familiar with pricing optimization, price elasticity, inventory management, competitive intelligence? Give examples.\n",
