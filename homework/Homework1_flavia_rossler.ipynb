    "# SYD DAT 4 Lab 1 - Git and Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "##Homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo called \"SYD_DAT_4\"\n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!)\n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",
    "  * \"Data Scientist\" is an ambiguous term that leads to impaired communication\n",
    "  * Data scientists are T-shape (broad skills with a more specific area of expertise) and Data science is an inherently collaborative and creative field.\n",
    "  * To be successful, Data Scientists need:\n",
    "     * an aspect of integration in the company's org chart\n",
    "     * direct access to both raw data and decision makers\n",
    "     * management support and a process for adopting and using their results\n",
    "     * funding and managerial relationship between analytics teams and the rest of the Business, including Infrastructure and IT\n",
    "     * allow job rotation to drive better understanding of the overall Business while providing opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n",
    "* Write a summary of 2 chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/) in Markdown and submit a pull request in the Lab Directory\n",
    "  * *TDJ Patil - VP of Products at Related IQ*\n",
    "     * You must put yourself in a position where somebody can actually take a risk on you, before they can give you the opportunity.\n",
    "     * Data science is a team sport.\n",
    "     * The difference between a data scientist that can tell you what the graph is doing versus telling you what action you need to do from the inside is a force multiplier by definition.\n",
    "     * Tips for improving probability of personal success: \n",
    "       *     **listen** hard \n",
    "       *     be a good **team player**\n",
    "       *     pick up trash,\n",
    "       *     make sure **balls don't get dropped** \n",
    "       *     take things of people's plates\n",
    "       *     be there for the team rather than as an individual  \n",
    "       *     **focus on delivering value** for somebody or something\n",
    "  * *Hilary Mason - Fast Forward Labs and Accel*\n",
    "     * Data gives people the power to make better decisions, so **the more people who have access to it the better**\n",
    "     * **Explaining** something **requires** **empathy**... it's not an easy task\n",
    "     * Prioritizing and making impact to the Business: for each data project you're working on, you need to ask yourself these questions:\n",
    "       *     What are you working on?\n",
    "       *     How will I know when it's done?\n",
    "       *     What does it impact?\n",
    "       *     If you're interested in Data Science, **try it**!\n",
    "       *     Try to do projects to play to your strengths, and sometimes do project that help you to improve your weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming\n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "     * **Idea No 1**: Predict customers who will miss payments in the future \n",
    "       *     Overview: for products which have yearly cycle with periodic payment instalments either monthly, fortnightly or yearly missing these payments can end up in cancellation of the product either in mid term or on renewal. The idea is to try to predict customers who will fall in payments in the next instalment\n",
    "       *     What data you will use: by identifying these customers the company can plan retention activities to avoid the payment to be missed in the first place\n",
    "       *     What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve: the list of policies that are likely to miss their payments in the next instalments and also be able to identify the customers who are worth retaining\n",
    "       *     Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve: maybe logistic regression for identifying if next payment will be either paid or missed - maybe also using idea 2 as input for this\n",
    "     * **Idea No 2**: Pet insurance customer segmentation \n",
    "       *     Overview: Pet insurance is a new industry and little we know about the categories of customers that purchase the product and their behavious\n",
    "       *     What data you will use: by identifying the characteristics of the customers in the base we can better define marketing activities, product ranges and service needs\n",
    "       *     What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve: the categories of customers that purchase pet insurance\n",
    "       *     Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve: thought about K-means or decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions: copy this file and append your name in the filename, e.g. Homework1_ian_hansel.ipynb.\n",
    "Then commit this in your local repository, push it to your github account and create a pull request so I can see your work. Remeber if you get stuck to look at the slides going over Fork, Clone, Commit, Push and Pull request.**"
