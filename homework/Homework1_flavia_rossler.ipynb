    "\n",
    "##Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo called \"SYD_DAT_4\"\n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!)\n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",
    "  * ''Data Scientist'' is an ambiguous term that leads to impaired communication\n",
    "  * Data scientists are T-shape (broad skills with a more specific area of expertise) and Data science is an inherently collaborative and creative field.\n",
    "  * To be successful, Data Scientists need:\n",
    "     - an aspect of integration in the company's org chart\n",
    "     - direct access to both raw data and decision makers\n",
    "     - management support and a process for adopting and using their results\n",
    "     - funding and managerial relationship between analytics teams and the rest of the Business, includin Infrastructure and IT\n",
    "     - allow job rotation to drive better understanding of the overall Business while providing opportunities\n",
    "* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n",
    "* Write a summary of 2 chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/) in Markdown and submit a pull request in the Lab Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming\n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "  * Overview of your idea\n",
    "  * What data you will use\n",
    "  * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve\n",
    "  * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions: copy this file and append your name in the filename, e.g. Homework1_ian_hansel.ipynb.\n",
    "Then commit this in your local repository, push it to your github account and create a pull request so I can see your work. Remember if you get stuck to look at the slides going over Fork, Clone, Commit, Push and Pull request.**"
