    "* For the following use the github repository you made for your project. \n",
    "* Load some data you have gathered for your project into Python.\n",
    "* Identify some numeric and categorical features in your data. Write this up in a file called README.md \n",
    "* Run some summary statistics over the numeric data.\n",

    "* When you are ready to submit, create a branch in your repository.\n",
