    "## Idea 1: Develop Predictive Model - Likelihood to Donate to Charity Based on Given Demographic + Geographic Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The charity sector is becoming increasingly competitive for fundraising, and organisations need to be efficient in how they allocate their marketing resources to ensure the greatest return. I propose creating and testing a model that predicts whether or not a someone is likely to donate to a specific charity given existing donation data and demographic, geographic, and publicly available health data.\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is that areas with higher prevalence in certain health conditions eg. heart disease, might dbe more likely to donate to related organisations.\n",

    "## Idea 2: AFL All-Australian Team Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year an 'All-Australian' AFL team is nominated by a judging panel to be the best 22 players (according to position) in the competition. This means the team can't simply be the best 22 players in the comp, but have to fit together like a real team - so the 22 best players at 22 different positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What complicates this effort is that the positions on the ground are somewhat fluid. Midfielders can play forward or back and vice-versa, whereas deep forwards and deep defenders would never move positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be a unique data challenge to identify any signals that lead to previous all-Australian teams, and use it to predict 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be done on a smaller scale and with greater samples for 'team of the week' published by afl.com.au.\n",

    "## Idea 3: Digital Media - Accounting for Cookie Bombing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a phenomenon in digital marketing colloquially referred to as 'cookie bombing' where vast numbers of low cost advertising inventory is used to place cookies on as many computers as possible so that if some kind of desired outcome is achieved, such as signing up for a credit card, the provider of that inventory can claim credit for the acquisition, and will be automatically favoured for more investment or future spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue with this is that a lot of inventory cheap inventory is not even viewable, so there are occurences where an ad is recieving credit even though there is no way that the user saw it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is can I use data science methods to identify and approximate the impact of 'cookie bombing' and develop a model for attribution that takes into account its probability\n",

    "It is valuable for travel insurers to understand who their highest value customers are. It is not always apparent from one policy whether or not a customer is likely to be a regular repeat customer.
