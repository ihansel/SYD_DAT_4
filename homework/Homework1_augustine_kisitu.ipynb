    "##Homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo called \"SYD_DAT_4\"\n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!)\n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",
    "\n",
    "My observations from reading the text above include the following;\n",
    "    * There is quite a bunch of hype about data scientists and because of this, data scientist might be mistakenly seen as miracle workers.\n",
    "    * Data Scientists can be categorised into four different skill sets which include;\n",
    "        * Data Researchers\n",
    "        * Data Creatives\n",
    "        * Data Developers\n",
    "        * Data Business People\n",
    "    * The categories above are based on different distribution of skillsets like programming, math/operational research, statistics, machine learning/big data and business\n",
    "    * Having a broad skillset is very valuable for data scientists (T-shaped Data scientist).\n",
    "    * As data scientist is important to be to communicate your areas of depth because it helps others to know where your expertise lies.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n",
    "* Write a summary of 2 chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/) in Markdown and submit a pull request in the Lab Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is a role that involves lots of collaboration and team work. It also requires a broad skill set which might include but is not limited to \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming\n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    " #### Lab 1 solutions\n",
    "   * filter DataFrame to only include European countries\n",
    "     *  `drinks[drinks.continent == 'EU']`\n",
    "   * calculate the average 'beer_servings' for all of Europe\n",
    "      * `drinks.beer_servings[drinks.continent == 'EU'].mean()`\n",
    "   * determine which 10 countries have the highest total_litres_of_pure_alcohol\n",
    "      * `drinks.sort('total_litres_of_pure_alcohol', ascending=False).head(10)`\n",
    "   * rename the column 'beer_servings' to 'beer'\n",
    "      * `drinks.rename(columns={'beer_servings': 'beer'}, inplace=True)`\n",
    "   * add a new column as a function of existing columns, total_servings = beer + wine + spirits\n",
    "      * `drinks['total_servings'] = drinks.beer + drinks.wine_servings + drinks.spirit_servings`\n",
    "   * remove the column you just added\n",
    "      * `drinks.drop('total_servings', 1)`\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "  * Overview of your idea\n",
    "  * What data you will use\n",
    "  * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve\n",
    "  * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve\n",
    "  \n",
    "  #### Course Project Ideas\n",
    "  * Analysing posts by people am following on twitter, to come with topics. The outcome is topics among which the different posts fall. I might probably use Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "  * Using github api to recommend projects that a user might be interested in based on what projects they star, what they regularly work on and who they follow. Not very sure what modelling technique i would use for this one\n",
    "  * Predict the likelihood of a customer being satisfied or not using an annonymized data set from Santander bank, (i got this idea from kaggle competition - [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction/data)). This sounds like a classification problem so i would probably use logistic regression.\n",
    "  * Analysing my gmail inbox to find relationships between the emails that i read, reply to, archive or never read.\n",
    "  * Using the australian weather data set to predict the weather, probably using logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions: copy this file and append your name in the filename, e.g. Homework1_ian_hansel.ipynb.\n",
    "Then commit this in your local repository, push it to your github account and create a pull request so I can see your work. Remeber if you get stuck to look at the slides going over Fork, Clone, Commit, Push and Pull request.**"
