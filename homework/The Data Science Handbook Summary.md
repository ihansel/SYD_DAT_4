This is a quick overview of the two first chapters of the book - interviews with **DJ Patil** and **Hilary Mason**.

DJ Patil - <i>VP of Products at Related IQ</i>

> **Highlights:**

> - You must put yourself in a position where somebody can actually take a risk on you, before they can give you the opportunity.
> - Data science is a <b>team sport</b>.
> - The difference between a data scientist that can tell you what the graph is doing versus telling you what action you need to do from the inside is a force multiplier by definition.

-------------
> **Highlights:**
