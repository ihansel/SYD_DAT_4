=======================

This is a quick overview of the two first chapters of the book - interviews with **DJ Patil** and **Hilary Mason**.

> **Highlights:**

> - You must put yourself in a position where somebody can actually take a risk on you, before they can give you the opportunity.
> - Data science is a <b>team sport</b>.
> - The difference between a data scientist that can tell you what the graph is doing versus telling you what action you need to do from the inside is a force multiplier by definition.
> - Tips for improving probability of personal success: **listen** hard, be a good **team player**, pick up trash, make sure **balls don't get dropped**, take things of people's plates, be there for the team rather than as an individual and **focus** on delivering **value for somebody or something**



Hilary Mason - <i>Fast Forward Labs and Accel</i>
-------------
>**Highlights:**
