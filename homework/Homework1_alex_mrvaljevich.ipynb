    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo called \"SYD_DAT_4\"\n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!)\n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",
    "* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n",
    "* Write a summary of 2 chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/) in Markdown and submit a pull request in the Lab Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming\n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "  * Overview of your idea\n",
    "  * What data you will use\n",
    "  * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve\n",
    "  * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions: copy this file and append your name in the filename, e.g. Homework1_ian_hansel.ipynb.\n",
    "Then commit this in your local repository, push it to your github account and create a pull request so I can see your work. Remeber if you get stuck to look at the slides going over Fork, Clone, Commit, Push and Pull request.**"

    "    * T-shaped skills are an interesting approach, i have to work on my statistics skills\n",

    "\n",
    "## Finding ideal thresholds for quantitative \"natural language\" metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is a wealth of quantitative metrics for web analytics (Bounce Rate, Time on Site, Pageviews) but none for the content portrayed on those sites. The objective of this project is to find natural language metrics that matter to outcomes (Likelihood To Read, Time on Site, Conversions) and then build a model to define ideal thresholds for a web property.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** All of the content of two popular we properties + the web analytics information associated to them.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Really interesting project. We should talk more about this, because it may be very difficult depending on your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pricing model for accomodations:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The site evasion.co.kr provides accomodations for Korean travelers, pricing for accommodations is set by benchmarking competitor prices but could be done based on intrinsic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** Database of accommodations, sales information, web analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Great idea, real problem that can be solved with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create model to optimize \"likelihood to engage\" in an online Peer to Peer support community.\n",
    "\n",
    "> At hellosundaymorning.org people form online support groups for changing the way they drink. Currently there is a \"discover\" feed that shows you new people as they are coming up, but is not optimized in any way for what people are shown. Some poeple don't have relatable expereinces to don't engage with one another, while others have differing points of view that create negative engagemetns. The idea is to create a model for what person should be introduced to which person.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** Database of user profiles, comments, posts, and conversations between users.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Similar to the first idea, I really like it. Just depends on the underlying data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding revenue opportunitites for Evasion.co.kr\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Optimization team at evasion.co.kr is currently operating off a backlog that is based on user feedback and basic web analytics, the objective of this project would be to perform exploratory work on their Db Data to find gaps in revenue model based on pricing, search ordering, missing information or other yet-unknown factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** Database of accommodations, sales information, web analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> This is a bit tricky as you're not really sure what you're looking for (especially given the time frame of the course). Although a good data profiling piece with some outlier analysis could be useful and applicable depending on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create model to define \"proportion of valence\" in a feed of posts at Hello Sunday Morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Hello Sunday Morning platform offers a feed of new posts for people to read and discover, the hypothesis is that given the right proportion of positive/negative posts the mood of the reader can be shifted towards higher openness to change and therefore better likelihood of dropping their alcohol consumption\n",

    "My take on these chapters is one about the defenition of an industry, more so than a role. \n",

    "The first is that we cannot forget this is a team sport, we need to work with the business and other Data Scientists if we are to get to the high levels of output that are expected in the industry.\n",

    "> Great write-up, it's a team sport (which ties in with the T-shape and complimentary skill sets). Yes, a lot of data science is trying things in different fields, that's one of the things that makes it great. Trying some things in a new field and seeing if it works."
