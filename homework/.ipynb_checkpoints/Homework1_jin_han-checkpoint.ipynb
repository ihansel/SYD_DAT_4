    "## Homework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo called \"SYD_DAT_4\"\n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!)\n",
    "> [nakatas/SYD_DAT_4](https://github.com/nakatas/SYD_DAT_4.git)\n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",
    "> 1. The most successful data scientists are those with substantial, deep expertise in at least one aspect of data science, be it statistics, big data, or business communication.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 2. T-shaped skills : \"T\" represents breadth of skills, across the top, with depth in one area represented by the vertical bar.\n",
    ">\n",

    ">\n",
    ">> * Data Businessperson: Leader, Businesperson, Entreperneur\n",
    "\n",
    "> It's great that you wrote a bit about the T shape, it's really important to have some knowledge of all those fields and choosing which field you want to specialise in. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n",
    "\n",
    "> It's clear by how you've laid out the homework you've read the book - great work !\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a summary of 2 chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/) in Markdown and submit a pull request in the Lab Directory\n",
    "> <p>1. RILEY NEWMAN Head of Data at Airbnb</p>\n",
    "> <pre><code>more data beats better models; better data beats more data; and the 80/20 rule. \n",
    "> </code></pre>\n",

    "\n",
    "> It's a simple description but it does a good job at explaining the different components\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming\n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    "> [nakatas/SYD_DAT_4/labs/Week 1/](https://github.com/nakatas/SYD_DAT_4/blob/master/labs/Week%201/Lab%201%20-%20Pandas.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "> <p>1. Predict which coupons a customer will buy</p>\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * What data you will use : past purchase and browsing behavior data provided by Kaggle\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve : prediction model for the recommendation system\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve : Collaborative filtering, Bayesian\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    ">> This would be a good one to try out.\n",

    ">\n",
    ">  * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve : Linear Regression \n",
    "\n",
    ">> Another good one to try out.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <p>3. Predict annual restraurant sales based on objective measurements</p>\n",
    "> \n",

    "> \n",
    "> * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve : a mathematical model to increase the effectiveness of investments in new restaurant sites\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve : k-mean clustering, Principal Component Analysis, k-nearest neighbours\n",
    "\n",
    "> <p>4. Predict which shoppers will become repeat buyers</p>\n",
    "> \n",
    ">   * What data you will use : 350 million rows of completely anonymised transactional data from over 300,000 shoppers provided by Kaggle\n",
    "> \n",
    ">   * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve : prediction model to know which shoppers will become repeat buyers \n",
    "> \n",
    ">   * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve : Decision Tree, Logistic Regression\n",

    ">\n",
    ">   * What data you will use : monthly online sales, advertising campaign,  data provided by Kaggle\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve : prediction model for monthly online sales of a product\n",
    ">\n",
    ">   * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve : Linear Regression \n",
    "\n",
    ">> All these ideas are great to try out. Did you have any other ideas other than kaggle competitions? It's ok if not, these are great to start with as they are nicely defined problems.\n",
