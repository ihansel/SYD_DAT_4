Hackers were skilled at programming and large-scale data management, and also often built sophisticated data visualizations. Scripters used statistical/mathematical programming languages like R and Matlab to do more detailed and sophisticated analyses of data sets typically provided by others. The group they called application users tended to use spreadsheets and other packaged analysis systems.\n",
