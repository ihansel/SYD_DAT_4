    "#### Setup\n",
    "* Resolve any installation issues before next class.\n",
    "* Make sure you have a github profile and created a repo called \"SYD_DAT_4\"\n",
    "* Clone the class repo (this one!)\n",
    "* Review this [code](../labs/Week 1/00_python_refresher.py) for a recap of some Python basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Communication\n",
    "* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists. Write down 5 key points you took away from the article\n",
    "* Read about some [Markdown Techniques](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\n",
    "* Write a summary of 2 chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/) in Markdown and submit a pull request in the Lab Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming\n",
    "* Complete the lab from class and the additional Exercise below\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Come up with 5 different ideas for your course project. For each one list:\n",
    "  * Overview of your idea\n",
    "  * What data you will use\n",
    "  * What the outcome is that you are trying to achieve\n",
    "  * Any ideas of modelling techniques it may involve\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions: copy this file and append your name in the filename, e.g. Homework1_ian_hansel.ipynb.\n",
    "Then commit this in your local repository, push it to your github account and create a pull request so I can see your work. Remeber if you get stuck to look at the slides going over Fork, Clone, Commit, Push and Pull request.**"

    "\n",
    "## Finding ideal thresholds for quantitative \"natural language\" metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is a wealth of quantitative metrics for web analytics (Bounce Rate, Time on Site, Pageviews) but none for the content portrayed on those sites. The objective of this project is to find natural language metrics that matter to outcomes (Likelihood To Read, Time on Site, Conversions) and then build a model to define ideal thresholds for a web property.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** All of the content of two popular we properties + the web analytics information associated to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pricing model for accomodations:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The site evasion.co.kr provides accomodations for Korean travelers, pricing for accommodations is set by benchmarking competitor prices but could be done based on intrinsic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** Database of accommodations, sales information, web analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create model to optimize \"likelihood to engage\" in an online Peer to Peer support community.\n",
    "\n",
    "> At hellosundaymorning.org people form online support groups for changing the way they drink. Currently there is a \"discover\" feed that shows you new people as they are coming up, but is not optimized in any way for what people are shown. Some poeple don't have relatable expereinces to don't engage with one another, while others have differing points of view that create negative engagemetns. The idea is to create a model for what person should be introduced to which person.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** Database of user profiles, comments, posts, and conversations between users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding revenue opportunitites for Evasion.co.kr\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Optimization team at evasion.co.kr is currently operating off a backlog that is based on user feedback and basic web analytics, the objective of this project would be to perform exploratory work on their Db Data to find gaps in revenue model based on pricing, search ordering, missing information or other yet-unknown factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** Database of accommodations, sales information, web analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create model to define \"proportion of valence\" in a feed of posts at Hello Sunday Morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Hello Sunday Morning platform offers a feed of new posts for people to read and discover, the hypothesis is that given the right proportion of positive/negative posts the mood of the reader can be shifted towards higher openness to change and therefore better likelihood of dropping their alcohol consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** Database of people, feed items, web analytics, and alcohol consumption surveys.  \n",

    "My take on these chapters is one about the defenition of an industry, more so than a role. \n",
    "Similar to what happened to product management for software about 15 years ago, this is a role that is not yet defined in the industry nor clear to practitioners or hirers. This is a great place to be as we are writing the rulebook as we go along. \n",
    "\n",
    "The potential is clear, and we are all sure that there is tremendous value in looking at data differently, with a mix of science, hacking, and magic to find new opportunities in this brave new world of interconnected data; Exaclty how is something we are trying to uncover now.\n",

    "A few things are important though: \n",

    "The first is that we cannot forget this is a team sport, we need to work with the business and other Data Scientists if we are to get to the high levels of output that are expected in the industry.\n",
